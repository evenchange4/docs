Introduction
===

The [Dashboard](https://dashboard.spark.io) is a new feature we're working on to make your lives easier. It's currently in beta, which means we'll be working on it and releasing frequent updates. Stuff might change a lot over the next few weeks, so check back often!

Being in beta also means we're trying to get your feedback as we build it. Head on over to the community to join the conversation. We'll be making release announcements, answering questions and asking for feedback.

Features
===

### Home (Coming Soon)

The Dashboard will show you an overview of your devices and their activity. It’ll let you easily monitor which devices are online, what code they’re running, and what data they’re sending back.

### Logs

You can watch events published from your devices with `Spark.publish()` come in, in realtime.

### Devices (Coming Soon)

The Devices view will display all your devices, their status, last messages, IDs, and manage their ownership.

### Data (Coming Soon)

The Data view will provide a processed view of the stored and incoming data, sorted by event and graphed where possible. You can also download stored data from here.

### Errors (Coming Soon)

Errors is where you’ll go to track alert messages that you’ve defined in your code. Think of it as `Serial.println()`, but with history and insights.

### Settings (Coming Soon)

Settings is where to find all the account things you’d expect, plus access token management.
